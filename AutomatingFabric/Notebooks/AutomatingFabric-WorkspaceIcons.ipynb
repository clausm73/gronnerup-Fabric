Since this is not an officially supported API, it may change without notice, which could impact the functionality of this approach. Use it with that in mind, and feel free to experiment!"],"metadata":{},"id":"1484bc5a-72b5-4ddf-9959-2de1d278964c"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%pip install pillow cairosvg --quiet"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"5eedfaf7-8a45-4daf-832b-1c6f15443fce"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import cairosvg\n","import io\n","import base64\n","import re\n","import json\n","import requests\n","import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n","import time\n","from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter, Retry\n","from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"4707afff-defc-425e-b59a-c5e4c4839209"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["is_dryrun = False\n","\n","must_contain = \"PeerInsights\"\n","either_contain = [\"dev\",\"tst\", \"prd\"]"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"03e0088c-8276-431d-983b-5bd11a93f0ad"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["############################################################################################################\n","# Power BI / Fabric Workspace functions\n","############################################################################################################\n","\n","def invoke_fabric_request(method, url, payload=None):\n","    \n","    headers = {\n","        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + notebookutils.credentials.getToken(\"pbi\"),\n","        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n","    }\n","\n","    try:\n","        session = requests.Session()\n","        retries = Retry(total=3, backoff_factor=5, status_forcelist=[502, 503, 504])\n","        adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries)\n","        session.mount('http://', adapter)\n","        session.mount('https://', adapter)\n","\n","        response = session.request(method, url, headers=headers, json=payload, timeout=240)      \n","        if (response.status_code == 202):\n","            operation_id = response.headers.get('x-ms-operation-id')\n","            \n","            # Poll the operation status until it's done - sleep 2 seconds between polls\n","            while True:\n","                operation_state_response = invoke_fabric_api_request(\"get\", f\"operations/{operation_id}\")\n","                operation_state = operation_state_response.json().get(\"status\")\n","\n","                if operation_state in [\"NotStarted\", \"Running\"]:\n","                    time.sleep(2)\n","                elif operation_state == \"Succeeded\":\n","                    response = invoke_fabric_api_request(\"get\", f\"operations/{operation_id}/result\")\n","                    break\n","                else:\n","                    break\n","        \n","        return response\n","\n","    except requests.RequestException as ex:\n","        print(ex)\n","\n","def get_cluster_url():\n","    response = invoke_fabric_request(\"get\", \"https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups\")\n","    response.raise_for_status()\n","    return response.headers.get(\"home-cluster-uri\")\n","\n","# Get cluster URL for use in metadata endpoints\n","cluster_base_url = get_cluster_url()\n","\n","def get_workspace_metadata(workspace_id):\n","    response = invoke_fabric_request(\"get\", f\"{cluster_base_url}metadata/folders/{workspace_id}\")\n","    response.raise_for_status()\n","    return response.json()\n","\n","\n","def set_workspace_icon(workspace_id, base64_png):\n","    if base64_png == \"\":\n","        icon = \"\"\n","    elif base64_png:\n","        icon = f\"data:image/png;base64,{base64_png}\"\n","\n","    if icon is not None:\n","        payload = { \"icon\": icon }\n","        try:\n","            response = invoke_fabric_request(\"put\", f\"{cluster_base_url}metadata/folders/{workspace_id}\", payload)\n","            response.raise_for_status()\n","            return response.json()\n","        except:\n","            print(f\"Could not set icon on workspace id {workspace_id}.
